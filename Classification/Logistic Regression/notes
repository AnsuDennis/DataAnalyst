y = b0 + (b1 * x) 

||

p = 1 / (1 + e ^ -y) => Sigmoid function 

||

ln(p / (1-p) ) = b0 + b1 * x 

best fitting line which fits the observations in data set (looks like plateau ) 

p hat = probability 

y hat (predicted value for dependent variable) 

if probability is belwo .5 then y hat = 0 else y hat is 1
