Classification is used to predict category. Regression is for predicting continuous number. Classification models incldue linear models like logistic regression, SVM and non-linear ones likes K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forest. We will implement following ML classification models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Kernel SVM
5. Naive Bayes
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification
